# List Gists App

### Description

Android App that lists public gists.

I did this as a part of a technical challenge in 24h. I ended up learning a bit about how to use Room, play more with RxJava and practise Kotlin.
This is not complete.

This is a sample project now :)

### Tools I used

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/)
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)

### Current State

This is showing up the list of public lists fetched with [GitHub API - REST API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/).
Data persistence isn't working.
